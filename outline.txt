Set up project outline, installing dependencies:
    1. npm install nodemon --save-dev
        nodemon for watching app in development stage
    2. npm install @babel/core @babel/node --save-dev
        Babel transpiles your code to vanilla JavaScript
    3. npm install @babel/preset-env --save-dev
        add .babelrc preset
    4. npm install dotenv --save
        -allows the .env variables in the source code to work
        -Add import 'dotenv/config' to the file using the .env variables
    5. npm install express
        -install the app, initialize it and use app.lister(port)
    6. npm install cors
        -Cross origian resource sharing, using this will allow other web sites to use ours
    7. npm install mongoose 
        -Install for mongoose models and the mongoDB interface
    8. npm install ejs 
        -install ejs as the view engine, also add the following to app.js: app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

    -Try a new project with express-generator to see how it is laid out
    --app.use(express.static('src')); had to use the preceeding...
4. Get an understanding of the Alpha Vantage API
5. Maybe use Python for charting the stock data
